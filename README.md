nme-tiled
=========

nme-tiled is a library gives NME developers the possibility to use the [TILED Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/).

Restrictions
-----------------

There are currently some restrictions in usage:

- You can't use the compressed ".tmx" format (Just plain XML works)
- You'll need to check if the editor puts your assets the same way as an NMML file would do into the ".tmx" or ".tsx" file
- You're not able to have multiple Tilesets with the same name
